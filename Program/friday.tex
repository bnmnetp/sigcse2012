    \multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small SIGCSE members love the beauty of computational thinking. They know the joy of bringing those ideas to young people. That love for computational thinking entails respect for the computational values that empower people in the digital world. For academics, those values have been central to the flowering of computing as an intellectual endeavor.

Today, those values are increasingly threatened by stresses from both within and outside academia: squabbles over who owns academic work, increasingly stringent and overreaching intellectual property laws, and the replacement of open computing platforms by closed applications and walled-garden application markets.

In this talk I'll describe some things we've done at MIT to support computational values, like open publication of all our course materials, our faculty policy on open publication of academic research, and our recently announced initiative for open online instruction based on non-proprietary software platforms. I'll discuss Creative Commons licensing and Free Software, and the importance of tinkerability for empowering citizens in an information society. And I'll describe App Inventor for Android, a new programming tool motivated by the vision that all of us us can experience mobile computing as creators using tools that we can control and reshape, rather than only as consumers of packaged applications. } \\

The goal of this approach is to bring the excitement, creativity, and innovation fostered by the context of creative coding.

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small We explore the use of sequences of small code writing questions ("concept questions") designed to incrementally evaluate single programming concepts. We report on student performance on a CS1 final examination that included a traditional code-writing question and four corresponding concept questions. We find that the concept questions are significant predictors of performance on both the corresponding code-writing question and the final exam as a whole. We argue that concept questions provide more accurate formative feedback and simplify marking by reducing the number of variants that must be considered. An analysis of the student responses categorized by the students' previous programming experience suggests inexperienced students have the most to gain from the use of concept questions.} \\ \\

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small The use of weekly, reflective student blogs can be one method for collecting ongoing feedback about a CS1 course. Reflective blogs permit a continuous feedback loop that can be used for both formative and summative assessment of pedagogical innovations. This paper reports on a two-year qualitative study involving the use of reflective blogging in six sections of two CS1 courses. Reflective blogs were used as a low stakes, non-intimidating vehicle whereby concerns, requests, and other course-related issues could be voiced by students. The posts were used as an assessment and feedback mechanism for pedagogical transformation of the participating courses. This study demonstrates that reflective blogs in CS1 can be a useful tool for faculty course development.} \\ \\

Since that time, workshops based on the Treisman model have been successful across the US and have resulted in more underrepresented minority students successfully completing Calculus. Some attempts have been made to translate the Treisman model to CS1, but all previous attempts have been focused on programming skills.  However, one of the student assumptions that deter underrepresented minorities from attempting a major or minor in CS is that a computer scientist is a solitary programmer. In this paper, we discuss a specific two year pilot program of non-programming focused Treisman-style workshops in conjunction with a CS1 course.} \\ \\

students has been a priority in the community for some time.  We present our
philosophy, collaboration across the curriculum, which moves beyond existing

manner.  In our approach, concepts are introduced and skills are developed
throughout the computer science curriculum---from CS1 to a capstone experience.
Students are provided with opportunities to exercise skills in reflective environments
that eventually mirror real-world experiences, and technical course content is
not compromised. We argue for this system and provide details about how collaboration
across the curriculum is accomplished at a small liberal arts college.}

Summer camps should also be sustainable, so that institutions can continue to offer them regularly.  The summer camps at Georgia Tech have evolved to the point where they are sustainable and effective. This paper presents the rationale for our camps, the business model that makes them sustainable, and the evaluation results that demonstrate positive attitude changes and increases in learning.} \\ \\

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small There continues to be a lack of adequate training for students in software testing techniques and tools at most academic institutions. Several educators and researchers have investigated innovative approaches to integrate testing into programming and software engineering (SE) courses with some success.  The main problem is getting other educators to adopt their approaches and getting students to continue to use the techniques.   

In this paper we present a study that evaluates a non-intrusive approach to integrating software testing techniques and tools in SE courses using a Web-Based Repository of Software Testing Tools (WReSTT).  The results of the study show that students who use WReSTT in the classroom can improve their understanding and use of testing techniques and tools.} \\ \\

In an effort to address this concern, we offered an advanced graduate-level course entitled “Agile Software Engineering” in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. The primary objectives of the course were to introduce the values and principles and practices underlying the agile philosophy, and to do so in an atmosphere that encourages debate and critical thinking. This paper describes our experiences during the offering of that course.} \\ \\

Gathering data as a basis for interventions, especially on a large scale, is hard. The BlueJ environment is being instrumented to collect data useful to a variety of educational programming researchers. BlueJ is ideally placed to collect such data: Users number in the millions, situated all over the world. This volume and diversity is unique in the history of such investigations and presents a significant opportunity for researchers. The data will be open to interested research groups, which will enable a wide variety of investigations that were previously impractical.

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small Pair Programming has been shown to be beneficial to student learning. This paper reports results of research investigating the effectiveness of pairing students based on their mental models. Prior research has found a correlation between mental model consistency and performance in computer programming courses. Students’ mental models helps to provide insights into how students approach problem solving and may indicate how to effectively pair students to improve their programming ability and learning. Results indicate that mental model consistency is a predictor of student success in an introductory programming course. Future goals of this research are to fully evaluate all pairing arrangements and to produce tests to evaluate mental model consistency for other computer science concepts.} \\ \\

The results from their use throughout the course, and for a single use of the whiteboards in a Computing Technology and Public Policy course, were quite positive. They resulted in a qualitatively different experience noticeable both to the instructors and the students. While some students were initially reluctant to use the whiteboards, by the end of the course most students were enthusiastic about their use.} \\ \\

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small While service learning projects in post-secondary computing can achieve important disciplinary outcomes for the students, the benefit of these projects for the service recipients and their community has been under-examined. This paper argues that since these projects are meant to benefit both student donors and community recipients, we must examine more carefully how computing service projects interact with all the social actors affected by the projects. Taking such an approach will require recognizing that ICT by itself will not increase democracy, equality, or any other social good; indeed some service learning projects may actually do more harm than good. The paper concludes with some sample computer learning projects that are oriented towards achieving true service for the recipients.} \\ \\

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small We designed a system where non-computational faculty members (along with undergraduates) enroll in an introductory, multidisciplinary, open source Geographic Information System (GIS) course to experience integrative learning as students. The faculty participants are subsequently required to integrate their newly acquired expertise with their own disciplinary teaching and research; the necessary time commitment is compensated by a three-credit teaching load reallocation. Our hypothesis is that increasing the general faculty's appreciation of computation (in the context of integrative learning) is an indirect yet effective and scalable way to reach a wider group of students to convey our fundamental disciplinary message: computing is more than programming and computing empowers people.} \\ \\

The study extends the work of Corney, Lister and Teague by qualitatively evaluating ‘explain in plain English’ responses to gain a deeper understanding of student misconceptions.  Statistical results from this study are similar to those of Corney, Lister and Teague.

We show such correlations may be explained by other factors, and we undertake a deeper analysis that reveals evidence of the positive impact question-generation activities have on student performance.} \\ \\

This paper reports the results from an empirical study that investigates whether social sensitivity is correlated with the performance of student teams on large semester-long projects. The overall result supports our claim. It suggests, therefore, that educators in computer-related disciplines should take the concept of social sensitivity seriously as an aid to productivity.} \\ \\

We present an alternative approach on presenting data structures using worked examples, i.e., by explicitly displaying the process that leads to the invention and creation of a data stucture and its algorithms. Our approach is heavily backed up by some of the best programming practices advocated by the Agile and Software Craftmanship communities and it brings the often mathematically oriented CS2 course closer to modern software engineering and practical problem solving, without a need for compromise in proofs and analysis.} \\ \\

\multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small One of the challenges facing the U.S. technological workforce is that fewer college graduates are being prepared for computing careers.

In this paper, we detail this approach, using a new introductory course oriented to science majors, and scholarships funded by the National Science Foundation Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (NSF S-STEM) program.

This paper presents a set of assumptions about the impact of technology on individuals and society and describes elements of a computing context designed to enable students to critically evaluate the technology that has such an impact on their lives.

Peer Instruction (PI): an active 
learning technique applicable to 
the teaching of many subjects,

short teaching segments. We 
will introduce and motivate PI, 
demonstrate its use  in 
combination with a clicker 
system, and show that PI is 
much more than the use of 
clickers.

Participants will work in groups 
to develop new PI questions 
addressing challenges to their 
students' learning, and discuss 
numerous pedagogical benefits 
conferred through PI.

Instructors interested in 
increasing engagement in any 
CS course may attend.

    \multicolumn{3}{@{}p{5in}}{\small We present the Program by 
Design introductory CS 
curriculum through the lenses 
of graphics, animations, 
algebra, and data structures.  
Animations programming is 
popular for CS1, but many such 
curricula lack clean paths into 
CS2.  Program by Design is 
different.  Using and reinforcing 
concepts from algebra, students 
learn to write animations 
(including standard topics such 
as model/view separation and 
event-handling), then move 
seamlessly into working with 
structured data, lists, trees, and 
objects.  The curriculum 
emphasizes design, testing, and 
writing maintainable programs, 
without losing the engagement 
of animations.  The workshop 
uses lectures and hands-on 
exercises to provide high-
school and college teachers an 
overview of the approach.  See
